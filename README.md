# WB-Data-Analysis

I scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on WB movies.

I did a wide range of Python & data science. They include:

Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
Cleaning data
Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
Working with dates (datetime library)
Saving & loading data with Pickle library
Accessing data from an API using Requests library
